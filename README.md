Miner Trouble is a simple, browser based, top-down puzzle game. It was inspired byt such games as [Chip's Challenge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip's_Challenge) and [Sokoban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). This game was created as part of the [2012 GitHub Game Off](https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off).
